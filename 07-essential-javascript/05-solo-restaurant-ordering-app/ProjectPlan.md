# Project Plan

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates frontend engineering fundamentals through a systematic, production-ready approach to building a web interface from Figma designs. The goal is to showcase technical skills, attention to detail, and the ability to translate design specifications into polished, interactive user experiences.

**Project Type:** Portfolio  
**Timeline:** Flexible, milestone-based approach  
**Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)

---

## Learning Objectives

- Master semantic HTML structure and accessibility best practices
- Develop robust CSS architecture using design systems principles
- Implement smooth, intuitive user interactions and animations
- Practice iterative development and refinement workflows
- Build portfolio documentation skills through reflective learning

---

## Milestones & Deliverables

### Milestone 1: HTML Foundation
**Goal:** Establish a semantic, accessible HTML structure

**Deliverables:**
- Complete HTML file with semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`)
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6)
- Accessible forms with labels and ARIA attributes where needed
- Valid HTML (passes W3C validation)

**Success Criteria:**
- HTML structure matches Figma layout hierarchy
- Screen readers can navigate the page logically
- No accessibility warnings in browser dev tools

---

### Milestone 2: Design System Setup
**Goal:** Create a scalable CSS foundation based on Figma specifications

**Deliverables:**
- CSS variables file or design tokens document containing:
  - Color palette (primary, secondary, neutrals, semantic colors)
  - Typography scale (font families, sizes, weights, line heights)
  - Spacing scale (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, etc.)
- Typography styles implemented

**Success Criteria:**
- All Figma colors are captured in CSS variables
- Typography matches Figma specifications exactly
- Design tokens are well-organized and documented

---

### Milestone 3: Asset Preparation
**Goal:** Export and optimize all visual assets from Figma

**Deliverables:**
- Exported images in appropriate formats
- Asset naming convention documentation
- Images optimized for web (compressed, properly sized)
- Asset inventory list

**Success Criteria:**
- All assets are under appropriate file sizes
- Naming convention is consistent and clear
- Assets are organized in logical folder structure

---

### Milestone 4: First Cut Layout
**Goal:** Build rough but functional layout with key interactions mapped out

**Deliverables:**
- Complete layout
- CSS Flexbox implementation
- Basic component structure
- Placeholder interactions (hover states, basic transitions)
- Comments documenting planned interactions

**Success Criteria:**
- Major sections are positioned correctly
- Basic hover states work
- Code is clean and commented for future refinement

---

### Milestone 5: First Cut Experience Flow
**Goal:** Implement end-to-end interactive user flow

**Deliverables:**
- JavaScript functionality for key interactions
-- show order summary section after adding an item
-- show pay modal after completing the order
-- show "thanks for order" after payment is done
- Functional (if rough) user journey from entry to exit
- Console logging or basic debugging in place

**Success Criteria:**
- User can complete the primary flow without errors
- Interactions feel responsive (not necessarily smooth yet)
- JavaScript is modular and readable
- Basic error handling is in place

**Questions to Answer:**
- Does the flow feel intuitive?
- Where do users hesitate or get confused?
- What feels good vs. what needs work?

---

### Milestone 6: Refinement & Polish
**Goal:** Elevate the experience with polished details and micro-interactions

**Deliverables:**
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Feedback mechanisms
- Accessibility enhancements:
  - Keyboard navigation fully functional
  - Focus states visible and appropriate
  - ARIA labels refined
- Performance optimization

**Success Criteria:**
- Experience feels polished and professional
- Accessibility score is 95+ (Lighthouse)
- Performance score is 90+ (Lighthouse)
- Works flawlessly in Chrome, Firefox, Safari

**Stretch Goal:**
- Improve upon the Figma design with thoughtful enhancements
- Add delightful micro-interactions not in original design
- Implement advanced accessibility features
- Create dark mode variant

---

### Milestone 7: Lessons Learned & Documentation
**Goal:** Reflect on the project and document learnings

**Deliverables:**
- **"I Like"** – What went well? What are you proud of?
  - Technical achievements
  - Design decisions that worked
  - Personal growth moments
  
- **"I Wish"** – What would you do differently?
  - Technical challenges that took longer than expected
  - Decisions you'd reconsider
  - Skills you wish you had going in
  
- **"What If?"** – Future possibilities and experiments
  - Features to add with more time
  - Alternative technical approaches to explore
  - New technologies or patterns to try

**Success Criteria:**
- Honest, specific reflections (not generic)
- Demonstrates growth mindset
- Shows understanding of trade-offs

---

**Technical Excellence:**
- ✅ Valid, semantic HTML
- ✅ Clean, maintainable CSS architecture
- ✅ Smooth, performant interactions
- ✅ 95+ accessibility score
