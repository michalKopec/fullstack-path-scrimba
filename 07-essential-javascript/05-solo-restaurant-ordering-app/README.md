## Stretch Goals

**Note:** Only attempt these if you've completed the core requirements and feel ready for additional challenges.

### Theme Customization
- Change the theme from a restaurant ordering app to another concept
- Modify the style to match your new theme
- Maintain all core functionality while adapting the design
- *Note: Working with Figma design specs is a key developer skill, so practice with the original design first*

### Meal Deal Discount
- Implement a discount feature for combined purchases
- Example: Apply 15% discount when a food item and drink are purchased together
- Calculate and display the discounted total price

### User Rating System
- Add a rating feature for the ordering experience
- Allow users to rate from 0 to 5 stars
- Display the rating interface at the end of the ordering process
